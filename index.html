      <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>main building</kbd></h4>
      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">was built in june 2015</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">Parkrose Middle School is a replacement school on the same site as the existing middle school that remained in operation throughout construction. The site circulation was redesigned to separate bus and vehicular traffic, and reduce peak drop-off and pick-up congestion.
        The basic building block of the learning areas is a studio space configured in the shape of a capital letter ‘L’ with each leg being of equal width, termed the ‘fat L’. This shape accommodates the formation and functioning of small learning groups while providing a sense of separation. This perspective recognizes that non-traditional contemporary learning environments encourage students to fully participate in activities with others as they learn and actively help direct their knowledge acquisition. Extending this spatial concept further, four studios are grouped together, including a science-focused space around a shared flexible extended learning area that supports differentiated teaching practices and varied group learning.
        Paired with another identical group, each set of eight studios then shares a quiet break-out space and either a multi-purpose studio for long-term focused subject staging or a computer lab. The close proximity of these spaces to the media center also allows greater flexibility and individual responsibility with learning.</p>

      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">also works as an auditorium</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">At Parkrose Middle School, the term "the commons" is used to describe a communal area that is designated for students to convene, dine, or interact with one another during breaks between classes. This space serves as a hub of social activity, where students can bond with their peers over meals, games, or other shared interests. Additionally, the commons also serves as a versatile venue for school events, such as dances, assemblies, or performances, providing ample space for large gatherings and activities. Overall, the commons is a vital component of the Parkrose Middle School community, fostering a sense of camaraderie and facilitating socialization among students.</p>

      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">has many books</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">The Media Center is a multifunctional facility that serves as a repository of knowledge and information in the form of a library, where individuals can access various types of resources such as books, journals, periodicals, and other materials. In addition to its primary function as a library, the Media Center also serves as a hub of activity, with a plethora of events and activities taking place within its walls. These events can range from educational workshops, seminars, and lectures, to social gatherings, artistic performances, and community events. In essence, the Media Center is a dynamic space that is constantly buzzing with activity, providing an avenue for individuals to learn, grow, and connect with others in their community.
